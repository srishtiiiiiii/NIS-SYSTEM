# NIS-SYSTEM
This project focuses on Network Intrusion Detection, aiming to identify unusual or malicious activity in network traffic. It employs both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to
detect intrusions effectively. It includes data preprocessing - Cleaning network traffic data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Labeled the data into "normal" and "intrusion" classes for binary classification.

This project uses three different models to enhance intrusion detection capabilities:

Random Forest Classifier (supervised): Achieved high accuracy (around 99.76%) in identifying network intrusions, with a balanced precision and recall.
Isolation Forest (unsupervised): Detected anomalies without labeled data, useful for identifying unusual patterns that may signify new intrusion types.
Neural Network (optional deep learning approach): Implemented for experimentation, providing a potential solution for large-scale data.

Insights

The high accuracy and recall indicate that the model is effective at identifying both known and new types of intrusions. The combination of supervised and unsupervised methods makes the system more 
versatile, adaptable to new attack patterns, and suitable for real-world applications. The project demonstrates a strong approach to intrusion detection by leveraging multiple models to enhance accuracy
and adaptability. The use of both supervised and unsupervised techniques ensures that the system is robust against known intrusions and flexible enough to flag anomalous behavior, even if it has not been
explicitly labeled as an intrusion. 
It provides a comprehensive, multi-model framework for network security, showcasing advanced data science and machine learning skills suitable for real-world applications in cybersecurity.
